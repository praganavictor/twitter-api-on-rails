# 1 day

* On my first day I've to decide what language I will use and I chose ruby, because I know Locaweb use ruby for most of the project's and because Akira Matsuda(https://github.com/amatsuda) convenced me at RubyConf2016.

* After decide the language I'have to understand how api works so I start search at google and I find this website(https://github.com/sferik/twitter), that website give me a idea about what i need to start, but my inexperience with rails make i lost all day.

# 2 day

* At my second day I learn a lot about rails, API and tests, with podcast's and some courses I bought at udemy.

* After study a lot at work and on the subway, at home I finally configure the API Twitter at 1 in the morning...
